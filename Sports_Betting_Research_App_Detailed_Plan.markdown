# Detailed Plan for a Sports Betting Research App

## Overview
The sports betting research app aims to provide users with actionable insights and predictions by leveraging a robust data ingestion system and fine-tuned pre-trained models like GPT-3 or BERT. The app will not build models from scratch but will adapt existing instruction-following models to the sports betting domain. The focus is on curating vast, detailed datasets and supporting a wide range of use cases to ensure insightful outputs.

## Data Storage and Ingestion

To enable the fine-tuned models to generate real, actionable insights, the app requires a comprehensive and detailed data foundation. The system will use a dual-storage approach with PostgreSQL for structured data and InfluxDB for time-series data, supported by Apache Airflow for ingestion pipelines.

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL (Structured Data)**:
  - **Purpose**: Stores relational data for complex queries and joins.
  - **Schema**: A detailed schema to capture a wide range of sports betting data:
    - **Players**: `player_id`, `name`, `team_id`, `position`, `age`, `height`, `weight`, `injury_status`, `contract_details`, `salary`.
    - **Teams**: `team_id`, `name`, `location`, `coach`, `win_loss_record`, `division`, `conference`.
    - **Games**: `game_id`, `date`, `home_team_id`, `away_team_id`, `venue`, `weather_conditions`, `attendance`, `referee`, `final_score`, `quarter_scores`.
    - **Odds**: `bet_id`, `game_id`, `bookmaker`, `odds_value`, `bet_type` (e.g., moneyline, spread, over/under), `timestamp`, `implied_probability`.
    - **Player Performance**: `performance_id`, `player_id`, `game_id`, `points`, `assists`, `rebounds`, `shots_made`, `shots_attempted`, `minutes_played`, `fatigue_index`.
    - **Events**: `event_id`, `game_id`, `timestamp`, `event_type` (e.g., goal, foul, substitution), `player_involved`, `context` (e.g., power play, overtime).
  - **Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `player_id`, `game_id`, `date`) for fast retrieval.
  - **Relationships**: Foreign keys link tables (e.g., `player_id` in `Player Performance` references `Players`).

- **InfluxDB (Time-Series Data)**:
  - **Purpose**: Optimized for time-series metrics, enabling rapid trend analysis.
  - **Data Points**:
    - Player metrics over time: `points_per_game`, `shooting_percentage`, `injury_recovery_time`.
    - Team metrics: `win_rate`, `average_score`, `defensive_rating`.
    - Odds fluctuations: `odds_value` with timestamps from multiple bookmakers.
  - **Granularity**: Store data at minute-level resolution for real-time trends (e.g., odds changes during a game).

### Data Ingestion
- **Sources**: Integrate with multiple sports data APIs to ensure vast and diverse data:
  - **SportsDataIO**: Player stats, game outcomes, historical data.
  - **OddsMatrix**: Real-time and historical odds from multiple bookmakers.
  - **Sportradar**: Play-by-play data, advanced analytics (e.g., expected goals, player tracking).
  - **ESPN APIs**: Contextual data like player interviews, team news.
  - **Weather APIs**: Game-day weather conditions (e.g., temperature, wind speed).
  - **Social Media APIs**: Sentiment analysis from Twitter/X for player and team morale.

- **ETL Pipelines (Apache Airflow)**:
  - **Extraction**: Pull data hourly (real-time odds), daily (player stats), or post-game (outcomes).
  - **Transformation**:
    - Clean data: Handle missing values (e.g., impute averages for missing stats), standardize formats (e.g., dates in ISO format).
    - Enrich data: Calculate derived metrics like `implied_probability` from odds, `fatigue_index` from minutes played.
    - Normalize: Ensure consistency across sources (e.g., unify player names).
  - **Loading**: Partition data into PostgreSQL tables and InfluxDB buckets by sport, season, and date for scalability.
  - **Scheduling**: Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) run pipelines at optimal intervals, with error handling and retries.

- **Volume and Variety**: Aim for millions of records per sport (e.g., NBA, NFL), covering 10+ years of historical data, multiple leagues, and international events (e.g., Olympics, World Cup).

## Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models

Rather than building models from scratch, the app will fine-tune well-known instruction-following models to generate sports betting insights.

- **Model Selection**:
  - **GPT-3**: For natural language generation (e.g., summarizing trends, explaining predictions).
  - **BERT**: For understanding queries and extracting insights from unstructured data (e.g., game summaries).

- **Fine-Tuning Process**:
  - **Dataset**: Curate a sports-specific corpus:
    - Game summaries and play-by-play commentary.
    - Player interviews and press releases.
    - Betting analysis articles and expert opinions.
    - Historical odds and outcome annotations.
  - **Training**: Use transfer learning to adapt the model to the sports domain, focusing on accuracy in predicting outcomes and generating insights.
  - **Output**: Fine-tuned models will respond to user queries like “Should I bet on Player X?” with detailed reasoning based on stats, trends, and odds.

- **Integration**: Deploy models via FastAPI endpoints, caching results in Redis for low-latency access.
